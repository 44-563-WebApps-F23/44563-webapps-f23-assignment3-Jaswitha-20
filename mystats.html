    I am currently pursuing masters in Applied computer science at Northwest Missouri State University.
    I am interested in playing sports like Badminton, Basketball. Apart from this I really enjoy art and craft. And also
    sometimes drawing simple designs or mandala art.
    <h4>My favourite food is Bisi Bele Bath</h4>
    <p>
        I like this dish because it is all in one meal and also nutritious.
        It tastes even best in the cool climate.
        It is a famous dish in Karnataka.
        It is a flavoured rice recipe with vegetables which is rich is in proteins and carbs.
