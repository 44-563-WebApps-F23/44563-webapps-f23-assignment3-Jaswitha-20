        I am currently pursuing masters in Applied computer science at Northwest Missouri State University.
        I am interested in playing sports like Badminton, Basketball. Apart from this I really enjoy art and craft. And also sometimes drawing simple designs or mandala art.
        <h4>My favourite food is Bisi Bele Bath</h4>
        <p>
            I like this dish because it is all in one meal and also nutritious.
             It tastes even best in the cool climate. 
             It is a famous dish in Karnataka. 
             It is a flavoured rice recipe with vegetables which is rich is in proteins and carbs.
